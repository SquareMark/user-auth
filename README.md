A project that shows the development of a responsive user authentication made with React Bootstrap (Front-End) and Firebase and Google auth (DB and a simple Back-End), in this the user can choose to register with their email or with their google account, once they have an account they can login, verify their user and even recover their password if necessary, the app can remember if the user has already logged in and saves their credentials. Among other highlights it shows how effective and fast is the use of a non sql db like firebase, very useful for creating and using dynamic apps.
